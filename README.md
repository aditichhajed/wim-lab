## 📂 Assignments

### **Experiment 1: Basic Internet Tools**  
- **Objective**: Learn to use internet tools like Email and FTP.  
- Tools: Gmail, Outlook, FileZilla  

---

### **Experiment 2: Profile Webpage**  
- Find a reference profile page that inspires you.  
- Create a similar profile webpage using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
- Extend the page to include all possible data types and make it highly interactive.  

---

### **Experiment 3: Webserver Installation and Deployment**  
1. Explore web server architecture and create an installation guide.  
2. Deploy your profile webpage on the installed web server.  
3. Use a pre-existing theme from **Bootstrap** or other frameworks and customize it.  
4. Implement data capture in **Excel/JSON/XML/Database** and display the captured data in a well-formatted HTML/CSS design.  

---

### **Experiment 4: Advanced Data Management**  
- Capture and validate user inputs.  
- Format the collected data into **CSV/JSON/XML** or save it in a database.  
- Visualize the data in tabular or graphical format.  

---

### **Experiment 5: PDF Report Generation**  
- Create a document explaining various approaches to generating PDFs.  
- Generate a **PDF report** with proper alignments, colors, and images, showcasing all data types.  

---

### **Experiment 6: Payment Gateway Integration**  
- Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Razorpay, Paytm, PhonePe) into your system.  
- Implement features for:  
  - Online payment via credit card, net banking, UPI, etc.  
  - Storing and updating payment details in the system.  
  - Generating and emailing/sending SMS payment receipts.  
- Create a document explaining the implementation process.  

---

### **Experiment 7: Integrated Application**  
- **Define a Problem Statement**:  
  - Combine all previous experiments into one integrated system.  
  - Include features like:  
    - Data collection and validation  
    - Email/SMS confirmation  
    - Payment processing and receipt generation  
    - Dashboard for visualizing data  
  - Ensure the application is realistic and usable after hosting.  
  - Data can be stored in **CSV/XML/JSON** or a database.  
- **Draw a Data Model**: For data requirements of the problem statement.  
- Present the integrated application and data model.  

---

### **Experiment 8: Final Report**  
- Prepare a detailed report summarizing the changes and final project created.  
- Highlight the integrated application's functionality, technical implementation, and use case.
